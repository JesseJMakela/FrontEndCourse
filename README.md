This contain my course work and project for developer skills: front end course

My project was a site where you can find my steam, faceit and youtube. The content revolves around game named counter strike.

link to the deployed site: https://beatsyhub.netlify.app/

If the site wants to be deployed offline from this folder it doesn't work. You need to use terminal to go to the project folder and deploy it from there or just only open the project folder and deploy the site from there.
